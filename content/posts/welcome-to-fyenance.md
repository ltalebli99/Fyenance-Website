We're thrilled to introduce Fyenance, a personal finance app built with privacy and simplicity at its core. In a world where financial apps have become increasingly complex and data-hungry, we saw the need for something different.

## Why We Built Fyenance

The journey to creating Fyenance started with a simple observation: most personal finance apps today require cloud sync, constant internet connection, and monthly subscriptions. While these features sound great on paper, they often lead to:

- Privacy concerns with sensitive financial data
- Slow performance and sync issues
- Complex features that most people don't need
- Recurring subscription costs that add up

We believed there had to be a better way. That's why we built Fyenance with a "less is more" philosophy.
