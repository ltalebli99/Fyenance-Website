We're excited to introduce Fyenance, a personal finance app that puts you back in control of your money. While most finance apps try to do everything automatically, we believe that true financial awareness comes from mindful tracking and organization.

## Why We Built Fyenance

Have you ever looked at your bank-connected finance app and wondered:
- Why are my transactions categorized incorrectly?
- Why is this split purchase showing up as one big amount?
- Why can't I find that specific expense I'm looking for?
- Why am I paying monthly just to see my own spending?

We built Fyenance because automatic bank synchronization, while convenient, often creates more confusion than clarity. When apps try to guess how to categorize your spending, they frequently get it wrong ‚Äì leaving you with a messy financial picture that takes more time to fix than if you'd tracked it yourself.

## What Makes Fyenance Different
