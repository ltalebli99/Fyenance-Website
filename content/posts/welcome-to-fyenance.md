We're excited to introduce Fyenance, a personal finance app that puts you back in control of your money. While most finance apps try to do everything automatically, we believe that true financial awareness comes from mindful tracking and organization.

## Why I Built Fyenance

Hi, I'm Lucas! Like many people, I've tried everything to track my spending: spreadsheets that became too complex to maintain, notes apps that were too basic, and handwritten budgets that I'd forget to update. I tried the popular finance apps, but they all insisted on connecting to my bank and auto-categorizing everything ‚Äì usually incorrectly, leading to spending more time cleaning up the constant mess than getting true insight.

I found myself constantly wondering where my money was actually going. Sure, I could look at my bank statement, but that doesn't nearly tell the whole story. That $200 Amazon charge could be split between household items, gifts, and groceries. That restaurant bill might be partially for work. And those recurring subscriptions? They're scattered across different cards and easy to forget about.

After years of inconsistent tracking and messy data, I decided to build the finance app I actually wanted to use. One that's simple enough to use every day, but powerful enough to give me real insights into my spending. No bank connections, no AI categorization ‚Äì just a straightforward way to track my money on my own terms.

## The Problem with Auto-Categorization

Most finance apps today automatically import and categorize your transactions from your bank. While this sounds convenient, it often leads to:

- **Incorrect Categories**: That Amazon purchase could be groceries, household items, or gifts
- **Missing Context**: Split purchases show up as one large transaction
- **Messy Organization**: Categories that don't match how you think about your spending
- **Time-Consuming Fixes**: Constantly correcting mis-categorized transactions
- **Monthly Fees**: Paying just to see your own spending data

## A Better Way to Track Your Money

We built Fyenance because we believe you shouldn't need to fight with your finance app. Instead of trying to guess how you spend your money, Fyenance lets you:

- **Track Mindfully**: Add transactions as they happen, staying aware of your spending
- **Organize Your Way**: Create categories that match how you think about money
- **Split Easily**: Divide purchases into multiple categories in seconds
- **See Clearly**: Get an accurate picture of your spending, not AI guesses
- **Pay Once**: Own the app forever for just $5, no subscriptions

## Simple by Design

Fyenance focuses on doing one thing well: helping you track and organize your spending. No bank connections, no sync issues, no complicated features you'll never use.

### Core Features
- üì± **Quick Entry**: Add transactions in seconds
- üîÑ **Recurring Transactions**: Track recurring expenses and income easily
- üè∑Ô∏è **Smart Categories**: Organize your way
- üìä **Clear Overview**: See your real spending patterns
- üí∞ **Multiple Accounts**: Track different accounts separately
- üìà **Simple Reports**: Understand your finances at a glance

## Why $5?

We believe good software should be affordable and straightforward. While the big finance apps charge monthly subscriptions ($5-15/month) to access your own spending data, we decided to be a bit rebellious: pay once, own forever.

No subscriptions means:
- You own the app outright (imagine that!)
- No pressure to add bloated features to justify monthly fees
- Focus on making the core experience great, not extracting value
- Updates and improvements included (because of course they should be)

At $5 ‚Äì less than a fancy coffee or one month of those other apps ‚Äì you get to keep Fyenance forever. It's our small stand against the subscription economy, and a price that keeps the app accessible while letting us maintain and improve it for the long term.

## Your Data, Your Device

In a world where every finance app wants to sync, analyze, and monetize your data in the cloud, we're taking a stance: your financial data stays on your device. Period.

No servers storing your transactions. No cloud sync to worry about. No data mining or selling your spending habits to the highest bidder. Just your financial data, safely stored on your device, exactly how it should be.

The only thing we ask for is your email address for your license and occasional updates about Fyenance. Radical concept, right? Simple and straightforward, like it should be.
