Quit my job, built a Chrome extension, now have paid customers from 40+ countries
B2C SaaS
Hi guys 👋, I am Choudhary Abdullah, and I have been building a Chrome extension that helps developers and designers inspect and fix UI issues on any website for the past 30 months. After months of hesitation, I have decided to share my story, which grew from a random idea to replacing my 9-5 job.

Numbers for the Curious
- 🚀 Solo developer, fully bootstrapped

- ⭐ 4.7 stars on Chrome Web Store

- 👥 6000+ active users

- 🌍 Paid customers from 46 countries

- 📦 Shipping 4-6 updates monthly

The Beginning
I was sitting with an old friend on a warm and bright June evening in 2022, having quit my job a few months earlier. We spent hours brainstorming product ideas, but nothing clicked. That night, I had this simple thought: what if I built an all-in-one browser extension for developers and designers? No market research, no fancy business plan – I just opened VS Code and started coding.

The Building Journey
- Month 1-3: Spent 14 hours/day coding, 7 days/week 😬

- Month 4: Launched on ProductHunt (200+ upvotes, 45+ comments)

- Month 6: Tweet went viral in Japan (96k views, 1000s of installs)

- Month 7: Launched the paid version, got 8 sales in the first week 😺

- Month 8: Built a proper website that increased sales by 4x

- Month 9-24: Kept improving the extension based on user feedback

- Month 25: Hit 6000+ users, got featured on Chrome Web Store 🎉

- Month 29: Now have paid customers from 46 countries

Key Lessons Learned
- Create an easy-to-use painkiller product and design it well

- Launch on ProductHunt, BetaList, and more to gain visibility

- Keep it free as long as possible to gain enough users 😬

- Get customer feedback and ship fixes and new features

- Launch the paid version after gaining enough users

- Do marketing: SEO, Cold Emails, Ads, Affiliates and more

Still building solo and still shipping features every month. The goal is to build something that helps developers and designers build beautiful websites faster while replacing my 9-5 job.
