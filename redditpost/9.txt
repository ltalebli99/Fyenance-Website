It took me 7 years to build something that finally gets sales
TLDR: 7 years of failed projects and 0 revenue. Launched my Starterkit that solved a real problem I faced - now +20 sales in 2 months

Over the past 7 years I have built countless projects trying to achieve that “big” breakthrough moment we all dream of as indiehackers but it never came. 

This stressed me so much at times that my health was severely impacted - I had anxiety, hair loss and heart and circulation problems Those 7 years were painful and bitter until I finally broke out of the following pattern and saw some results 

• Get excited about an idea

• Work obsessively for a months

• Hit a wall (no interest, no users, no traction)

• Lose motivation and stop

• Repeat with new shiny idea

After years of repeating this cycle, it became clear: just building something isn’t enough. 

You have to solve a real problem, and you have to put yourself out there.

The Turning Point

Everything changed when I needed to learn React Native for a startup project. Despite knowing React and web development, building a mobile app was much harder than I expected. Setting up basics like authentication, push notifications, and app store submissions took weeks of trial and error.

The same thing happened when I built contxt-app(.)com, a React Native project with a small team. We spent most of our time debugging and working through technical hurdles instead of focusing on the actual product. That app never took off, but the experience planted a seed.

Last year, I decided to package everything I’d learned about React Native into something useful: NativeExpress, a starter kit for building mobile apps. My goal was simple: save other developers from the headaches I’d gone through. At worst, I’d have my own starter kit for future projects. At best, it might actually sell.

Building and Launching NativeExpress

I started small – just a blank Expo project, pulling in components and patterns I’d used before. But the hard part wasn’t coding; it was writing detailed documentation, creating tutorials, and explaining things clearly enough for other developers.

I built the first version of the product and landing page in under a month and decided to launch with preorders. To my surprise, people started messaging me on Twitter/X asking for early access. I wasn’t even finished, but I promised delivery in three days. Cue a lot of late nights.

By September 2024, I’d made my first €700 from five preorders. It might not sound like much, but for me, it was life-changing. After years of failure, someone finally paid for something I built.

The soft launch followed in October, and since then, NativeExpress has made €4,548 in revenue in just 2 1/2 months. It’s not a huge number, but it’s proof that this can work – and it’s given me the confidence to keep going.

What I’ve Learned

Marketing is key** – I used to think building was the hard part, but without marketing, no one will ever know your product exists. Share your journey early and often.

Solve real problems** – My early projects failed because they didn’t address real pain points. NativeExpress is succeeding because it solves a problem I experienced firsthand.

Launch fast, improve later** – You don’t need a perfect product to start selling. My first customers were happy to buy an unfinished product because they trusted I’d deliver.

Community matters** – Sharing my journey on platforms like Twitter/X and Reddit has been invaluable. The support and feedback I’ve received are what keep me going.

The Future

Right now, I’m still balancing my 9-5 with NativeExpress, but my dream is to build enough income to leave my job. My short-term goal is to make sales more consistent without having to hustle every day. Long-term, I’d love to launch a second product or maybe even start an agency.

For anyone reading this who’s struggling with their indie hacking journey: don’t give up. Focus on solving a specific problem, put yourself out there, and don’t be afraid to launch before you’re ready.

I’m still figuring things out, but I’d love to connect with others on the same path.

Feel free to reach out and if you want to make my day I am currently launching on Product Hunt and your upvote could really help!
