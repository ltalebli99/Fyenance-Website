Starting your online business is so cheap today
• Figma: $0

• Next.js: $0

• Supabase: $0 (for up to 50k users)

• Umami: $0

• Resend: $0 (for up to 3k emails/month)

• Domain: $10

• Stripe: $0 (1.5% - 2.5% fee)

In the end, it’s just $10 and a couple of free hours per day — and you could potentially create a billion-dollar company.

Don’t listen to pessimists who say, "The chances are so low" or "Nobody will buy your product". Low chances they have to get up off their lazy ass and start doing something themselves.

I believe in you!
