I made a Screenshot-Tool in a weekend as a fun project. Now $500 in sales so far. I Can’t believe it
It’s been a few weeks since I launched PimpMySnap, and I wanted to share my journey of how a sideproject for fun turned out to have some potential as a micro-saas.

PimpMySnap is a tool that spices up screenshots by adding animated backgrounds, stickers, and highlights—basically making them way more eye-catching.

In the first weeks, I’ve made $500 in sales, which feels incredible is mind-blowing to me since it's a side project I put together quickly and just for fun.

Here’s how it all came together: 

Background:
The idea came from scrolling Twitter and noticing how many posts were screenshots—metrics, dashboards, portfolios, etc. I wanted mine to stand out, so I started to play around with adding gifs to screenshots and seeing how difficult that was I started building. The first version was simple: animated backgrounds and stickers, but it was enough to get started. 

Launch 
The launch was as low-key as it gets. I made a short demo video and shared it on Twitter with a giveaway: lifetime access to 10 random people who retweeted. That one post got 30K views and brought in my first sales. I got really lucky with that one but one thing I can tell don't overthink this and just start to market - you cant overdo it...

Marketing 
Marketing has been a mixed bag, but here’s what worked so far:
1. Twitter/X: The launch post was my main driver of traffic and sales. I also use the tool myself for every screenshot I share, leaving the watermark on purpose. It’s a subtle way to spark curiosity.
2. Microlaunch: I shared PimpMySnap here and it became the #2 product of the month, which brought in a nice boost of visibility.
 
What’s next? 

Keep using and improving the tool—it’s been fun seeing people use it, and I’ve got a list of new features I want to build.

Experiment with more marketing channels (thinking of some influencer collaborations).

Stay consistent. My goal is simple: get at least one new user every day and keep learning. This has been such a fun project so far. I’ve learned a lot about launching fast, keeping things simple, and staying focused on small wins.

If you’ve got any feedback or ideas, I’d love to hear them!
