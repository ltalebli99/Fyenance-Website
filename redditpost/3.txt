I built an app over the weekend and it got 10K visitors in 12 hours
Hey everyone, I first got the idea for this app almost 6 months ago.

It's an app where you can save ideas but with a twist - you set an expiry date, and after it expires, your idea goes public.

This was the inspiration behind it - we all have tons of ideas every day, but we never work on 95% of them. At the same time, there are plenty of people who want to build something but can't think of what to make.

So either the expiry date motivates you to actually work on it, or the idea goes public and someone else gets to bring it to life. Win-win.

Finally decided to built it this Sunday.

Decided not to over engineer. Kept it super simple, and added just the basic features. Finished it by night, posted it on HackerNews, Reddit, and Twitter and went to sleep.

Woke up next morning to an email saying my Vercel analytics was maxed out. Best email ever!

The post blew up on HackerNews and my app got 6K+ visitors in 7 hours.

People started asking for features like votes, sorting, comments, etc - implemented some of them the same day and By afternoon, it got 10K+ visitors.

Learned a good lesson that we all need to stop over-engineering stuff. I had so many feature ideas but controlled myself and thought "fk it, let's launch first and add what users actually want."

So if you have an idea, just build the minimum and ship it. If you don't, you can find one here - https://ideaharbor.xyz

Don't overcomplicate it. Just focus on getting the users and let them tell you what features they want.
