Our side project reached $1100 MRR in 2 months and went from being a side project to a full-time job
My brother and I have spent the past 8 months building 3 projects, 2 of which failed, but one of them recently hit 1900+ users and $1100 MRR in two months.

Here’s the link to the project for the curious: https://buildpad.io

I could never have imagined this two months ago when we were struggling hard with marketing and trying our best just to get people to sign up for our projects. Now all of a sudden our project has turned into a full-time job!

I like seeing behind-the-scenes stats for other projects, so here our stats for November:

Average unique weekly visitors: 1525

Average weekly sign ups: 121

Landing page conversion rate: 9.5%

Free user to pro conversion rate: 7.1%

New pro subscriptions: 34 The next big dream milestone now is scaling it to $10k MRR! Let’s see if we can do it.

I’m wishing you guys all the best and I hope you get to experience this with your project one day!
